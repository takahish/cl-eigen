;;;; This file describes functions for generating quasi-random sequences in
;;;; arbitrary dimensions. A quasi-random sequence progressively covers a
;;;; d-dimensional space with a set of points that are uniformly distributed.
;;;; Quasi-random sequences are also known as low-discrepancy sequences. The
;;;; quasi-random sequence generators use an interface that is similar to the
;;;; interface for random number generators, except that seeding is not required
;;;; each generator produces a single sequence.
