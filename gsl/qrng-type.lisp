;;;; This file describes functions for generating quasi-random
;;;; sequences in arbitrary dimensions. A quasi-random sequence
;;;; progressively covers a d-dimensional space with a set of points
;;;; that are uniformly distributed.  Quasi-random sequences are also
;;;; known as low-discrepancy sequences. The quasi-random sequence
;;;; generators use an interface that is similar to the interface for
;;;; random number generators, except that seeding is not required
;;;; each generator produces a single sequence.
