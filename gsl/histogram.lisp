;;;; Histograms provide a convenient way of summarizing the
;;;; distribution of a set of data. A histogram consists of a set of
;;;; bins which count the number of events falling into a given range
;;;; of a continuous variable x.  Once a histogram has veen created it
;;;; can also be converted into a probability distribution
;;;; function. The library provides efficient routines for selecting
;;;; random samples from probability distributions. This can be useful
;;;; for generating simulations based on real data.
